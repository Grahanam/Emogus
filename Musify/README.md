# Interative 3D Model Animation

This repository contains code for creating an interactive 3D model animation using Three.js. The animation allows users to control the rotation of a 3D model using mouse movements.

Live Demo : [Emogus](https://grahanam.github.io/ThreeJs-Examples/Emogus/index.html)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

- Clone this respository to your local machine.
- Open the project directory in a code editor of your choice.
- Serve the project directory using a local development server or by opening the 'index.html' file directly in a web browser.
- Interact with the 3D model using mouse movements to see the rotation effect.

## Dependencies 

This project relies on the following libraries:

- Three.js: A JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser.


## Acknowledgement
